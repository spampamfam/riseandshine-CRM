ALTER TABLE leads DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS leads_status_check;
ALTER TABLE leads ADD CONSTRAINT leads_status_check 
    CHECK (status IN ('new', 'contacted', 'qualified', 'disqualified', 'callback', 'inventory', 'converted'));

-- Create lead notes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lead_notes (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    note_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    note_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'general', -- general, status_change, admin_note
    is_admin_note BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create RLS policies for lead_notes
ALTER TABLE lead_notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view notes for their own leads" ON lead_notes
    FOR SELECT USING (

            SELECT 1 FROM admin_roles

            AND leads.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
